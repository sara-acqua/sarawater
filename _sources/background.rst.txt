Background
==========

SARAwater is a Python package for analyzing different types of alterations in river reaches subject to flow abstraction, under different flow management scenarios. It is designed to help water resource managers and environmental scientists assess the ecological impacts of water abstractions and develop sustainable management strategies.

IHA index
---------
IHA index that comes from the italian IARI 
Indexes of Hydrologic Alteration (IHA) is a widely used method for assessing the ecological impacts of flow alterations in rivers [1]_. 

Utilizzato come pre and post impact assessment, qui invece lo usiamo per valutare upstream e downstream di un punto di prelievo.

MesoHABSIM
----------
The MESOHABSIM (Mesohabitat Simulation) model is a tool for simulating the physical habitat conditions in river systems. It allows users to assess the impacts of flow alterations on aquatic habitats by modeling the availability and quality of different habitat types under various flow scenarios. SARAwater provides functionalities for running MESOHABSIM simulations and analyzing the results.
