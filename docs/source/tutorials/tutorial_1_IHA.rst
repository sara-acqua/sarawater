Tutorial 1: Indicators of Hydrologic Alteration (IHA)
=====================================================
This tutorial demonstrates how to use the `SARAwater` package to compute the Indicators of Hydrologic Alteration (IHA) for a river reach, comparing the hydrological regime upstream and downstream of the abstraction. The IHA is a widely used method for assessing the ecological impacts of hydrological changes.
